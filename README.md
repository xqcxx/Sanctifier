# Sanctifier 🛡️

**The Definitive Security & Formal Verification Suite for Stellar Soroban**

Sanctifier is an institutional-grade security framework built to ensure that "Code is Law" remains a reality on the Stellar network. By combining **Static Analysis**, **Formal Verification (Kani)**, and **Runtime Guardians**, Sanctifier provides a multi-layered defense system for the next generation of DeFi and Fintech applications on Soroban.

## 🚀 Vision

In an ecosystem where security is non-negotiable, Sanctifier serves as the "Proof-of-Trust" layer. Our mission is to eliminate common vulnerabilities and provide developers with the formal certainty required to manage billions in on-chain assets safely.

## 📁 Project Architecture

Sanctifier is designed with a modular, tool-chain approach:

- **`tooling/`**: The Rust-based engine for static analysis and formal verification bridges.
- **`contracts/`**: A library of reusable, security-hardened contract templates and guards.
- **`frontend/`**: A sleek, real-time dashboard for visualizing "Sanctity Scores" and security logs.
- **`docs/`**: Deep technical guides on formal methods and Soroban security best practices.

## 🛠 Targeted Security Layers

### 1. Static Analysis (The Sentinel)

Scans your Soroban code at compile-time to detect:

- **Authorization Gaps**: Missing `require_auth` or weak access controls.
- **Storage Collisions**: Improper usage of Instance vs. Persistent storage.
- **Arithmetic Safety**: Proactive detection of potential overflows and underflows.

### 2. Formal Verification (The Absolute)

Integrates with **Kani** and SMT solvers to provide mathematical certainty:

- **State Invariants**: Proving that a contract's state can never enter an invalid or "hacked" mode.
- **Initialization Guards**: Mathematically ensuring `initialize` functions are truly idempotent.

### 3. Runtime Guardians (The Shield)

A library of opt-in hooks to monitor contract health live:

- **`guard_invariant()`**: Reverts transactions if high-level business logic is violated.
- **`monitor_events()`**: Automates the verification of critical event emissions.

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
cargo install --path tooling/sanctifier-cli
```


### Quick Scan

Run an initial security audit on your project:

```bash
sanctifier analyze ./contracts/my-project
```

#### LLM-Assisted Explanations (Experimental)
To get plain-English explanations and mitigation strategies for findings, use:
```bash
sanctifier analyze ./contracts/my-project --llm-explain
```
Set the `LLM_API_URL` environment variable to point to your LLM API endpoint (defaults to http://localhost:8000/explain).

## 🗺 Roadmap

Sanctifier is **Open-Source and Ecosystem-First**. Our 30+ issue roadmap covers everything from enhanced formal verification bridges to real-time security dashboards. See [Issues](https://github.com/Hypersecured/sanctifier/issues) for 'Good First Issues'.
